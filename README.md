# Analyzing Risk Factors for Diabetes

**Author:** Isaiah Dominguez  
**Tools:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

## Project Overview
This project explores a clinical dataset to identify patterns associated with the risk of developing diabetes. The analysis involves data cleaning, feature engineering, statistical description, and a visual exploration of health metrics like BMI, Glucose, Insulin, and Age.

## Key Objectives
- Clean and preprocess clinical data with biologically invalid entries (e.g., 0 for BMI/Glucose).
- Visualize the distributions of BMI and Glucose among diabetic and non-diabetic groups.
- Use boxplots, histograms, and correlation heatmaps to uncover feature relationships.
- Explore the influence of the Diabetes Pedigree Function on health metrics.

## Results
- Diabetic patients tend to have significantly higher average BMI.
- Glucose is the most strongly correlated variable with diabetes presence.
- Heatmap and boxplot visualizations reinforce statistical findings.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data visualization using Seaborn & Matplotlib
- Feature engineering with NumPy

## Output
- ðŸ“˜ Jupyter Notebook: `Analyzing Risk Factors for Diabetes.ipynb`
- ðŸ“„ Final Report (PDF): `Analyzing Risk Factors for Diabetes.pdf`
